C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ see) is a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.[2]
Although C was designed for implementing system software,[5] it is also widely used for developing portable application software.
C is one of the most popular programming languages of all time[6][7] and there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which began as an extension to C.
